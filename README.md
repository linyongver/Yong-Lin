## About Me

I am an CSE PhD sudent in HKUST, supervised by Professor [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/). **Out of Distribution  (OOD) Generalization** , **Robustess of Deep Learning** and **Learning theory** are my research interests. Particularly, we are now working on topics related to **Invariant Learning**. 

If you are also interested in discussing / cooperating with me on OOD, you can contact me by Email (ylindf(A)connect.ust.hk {A = @}). 

I have lunched a blog on Invariant Risk Minimization [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/567666715) (in Chinese).
